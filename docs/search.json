When a player holds, the turn total (the sum of the dice rolls during that turn) is added to their overall score.\nWinning: The game continues until one of the players reaches or exceeds 100 points."

Common applications of DL include natural language processing (NLP), medicine, security (computer vision), industrial automation (anomaly detection), and commercial recommendation systems.\nWhen discussing DL, it is crucial to emphasize its fundamental element: the Neural Network. The concept of neural networks was first developed by Pitts and McCulloch. The Mark I Perceptron was the first artificial neural network constructed based on their ideas. However, the Perceptron was limited to a single layer and struggled to learn some simple functions, such as XOR. To create more powerful neural networks, it is essential to add more layers, which is a common technique in building effective models in DL.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3 element that lead AI to become famous\n\n\n\n\n\nABC : Algorithms, Big Data, Computing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n!pip install staring with a ! is a bash code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode First, Theory Later\n\n\n\nTrying to spend too much time on theory can be counterproductive.

    "section": "Answer",
    "text": "Answer\n\nFFFF.\nFive areas that DL are good at: natural language processing (NPL), Medical image, security(computer vision), factory(industrial | anomaly detection) and recommendation system(commercial).\nThe first device that was based on the principle of the artificial neuron is : The Mark I Perceptron.\nRequirements for the parallel distributed processing:\n\na set of processing unit\na state of activation\nan output function for each unit\na pattern of connectivity between units\nA propagation rule for propagating patterns of activities through the network of connectivities\nAn activation rule for combining the inputs impinging on a unit with the current state of that unit to produce a new level of activation for the unit\nA learning rule whereby patterns of connectivity are modified by experience\nAn environment within which the system must operate\n\nTwo theoretical misunderstandings that held back the field of neuron networks is:\n\nAdding one more layers (2 layer) then it will be possible to approximate any function.\nAdding more layers to make model better\n\nGPU is a kind of processor which can do the parallel computing, it is commonly used in training the model.\nBecause traditional computer does not come with a GPU, hence its computation speed is slow and inefficient.\nSamuel mean by “weight assignment” refer to setting the value of variable on how the function works/behave.\n“weight” is refer to “parameters” in deep learning.\nBecause some problems such as image recognition, we unconsciously know how our brain can recognize patterns in such images.\nUniversal approximation theorem.\nData(input) and labels(model output references).\nUsing feedback loop can be problematic, the more biased of dataset, the more biased of the model.\nNo, we can use any size, using image of size 264x264 is due to historical reason (traditional model can only trained using 264x264 size).\nClassification is for predicting the categories of dataset while Regression predict numerical value.\nValidation set is an less exposed data set which is used to find the optimal hyperparameters of various architectures of model. Test set is used to predict the unseen data and evaluate the model overall performance.\nFastAI will automatically set the validation set to 0.2 (20%).\nNo, we can’t. A counter case is training with time-series data which is too easy for model to to fill the gap, when we select random validation instances.\nOverfitting is a problem when the model perform very well on training data set but perform poorly in predicting unseen data. An example : when a model is trained to decide the image is cat or dog, model can only accurately make a classification when given an instance within train dataset. But fail when given cat or dog image outside the training set (or the cat image that is not similar to the images within training set).\nMetric is a version of loss which used for human (make it more understandable for human), it can be error percentage or accuracy.\nUsing pre-trained model, can increase training efficiency, because pretrained model (already has more capability) can already recognize basic patterns of data.\nHead of a model is the last layer of the model. Note that we need to change the head of model (one or more layers to make it suitable for specifics task of the model) while using pre-trained model.\nThe first layer of CNN, it determines diagonal, horizontal, and vertical edges as well as various gradients. 2nd layer the model detects features within the image such as circle, triangle etc.\nImage models are not only useful for photos, but also useful in other type of input. For instance, voice signal can also express in term of spectrum as photos.\nArchitecture is the pre assume functions or structure of the model.\nSegmentation is task where photos are divided and recognized into small components labels. For example, self driving car might use video data and do the segmentation recognize the pedestrian in order to adjust direction or speed.\ny_range is used for setting a range in label for specific task (when we only interested in a specific range of values).\nHyperparameters are the specification of the model that are manually set by human such as model architecture, learning rate, hidden layers number etc.\nBest way to avoid failures when using AI in an organization is to keep a test dataset separately (without intervening with training process)."

It’s also used for predicate nouns or pronouns that refer back to the subject.\nHere are some examples of how the nominative case is used:\n\nSubject of a Sentence: The noun or pronoun that performs the action of the verb.\n\n“Der Hund bellt.” (The dog barks.)\n“Sie liest ein Buch.” (She reads a book.)\n\nPredicate Nouns or Pronouns: Nouns or pronouns that rename or describe the subject in a sentence.\n\n“Mein Bruder ist Arzt.” (My brother is a doctor.)\n“Der Himmel ist blau.” (The sky is blue.)\n\nApposition: When two nouns or noun phrases are used together to describe the same person or thing.\n\n“Meine Mutter, eine Lehrerin, kommt bald.” (My mother, a teacher, is coming soon.)\n“Der Mann, mein Nachbar, ist sehr freundlich.” (The man, my neighbor, is very friendly.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accusative case is one of the four grammatical cases in German. It indicates the direct object of a sentence, often answering the question “what?” or “whom?” The accusative case is used for the noun or pronoun that directly receives the action of the verb.\nHere are some examples of how the accusative case is used:\n\nDirect Objects: In sentences where the action of the verb is directly applied to something or someone.\n\n“Ich sehe den Mann.” (I see the man.)\n“Sie liest ein Buch.” (She reads a book.)\n\nMotion Toward: When indicating motion towards a specific location.\n\n“Er geht in den Park.” (He goes into the park.)\n“Sie fahren in die Stadt.” (They drive into the city.)\n\nDuration or Time Span: When specifying a duration of time.\n\n“Ich habe den ganzen Tag gearbeitet.” (I worked the whole day.)\n“Wir haben den Film gestern gesehen.” (We watched the movie yesterday.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dative case is one of the four grammatical cases in German (the others being nominative, accusative, and genitive). It indicates the indirect object of a sentence, often answering the question “to whom?” or “for whom?” The dative case is used for the recipient of an action or the object that is indirectly affected by the verb.\nHere are some examples of how the dative case is used:\n\nIndirect Objects: In sentences where something is given or done to someone or something else.\n\n“Ich gebe dem Mann das Buch.” (I give the book to the man.)\n\nCertain Prepositions: Some prepositions in German always take the dative case.\n\n“Ich gehe mit meinem Freund.” (I am going with my friend.)\n“Er spricht mit dem Lehrer.” (He is speaking with the teacher.)\n\nDative Objects with Verbs: Some verbs are used with dative objects, indicating who or what is indirectly affected by the action.\n\n“Ich helfe meiner Schwester.” (I am helping my sister.)\n“Sie glaubt dem Arzt.” (She believes the doctor.)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe genitive case is another grammatical case in German, indicating possession or the relationship between nouns. It often answers the question “whose?” or “of whom/what?” The genitive case is used to show ownership, association, or origin.\nHere are some examples of how the genitive case is used:\n\nPossession: Showing ownership or possession.\n\n“Das Auto meines Vaters.” (My father’s car.)\n“Die Farbe des Himmels.” (The color of the sky.)\n\nRelationships: Indicating relationships between nouns.\n\n“Die Stimme der Sängerin.” (The voice of the singer.)\n“Das Land der Träume.” (The land of dreams.)\n\nCertain Prepositions: Some prepositions in German always take the genitive case.\n\n“Wegen des Wetters.” (Because of the weather.)\n“Trotz des Regens.” (Despite the rain.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn German, “ein,” “eine,” and “einen” are all forms of the indefinite article “a” or “an” in English.

    "text": "Out of memory error (OOM) is the common problem in fine-tuning LLMs. To tackle with this problem, we use can use q-LoRA to fine tune the model. However, some of the LLMs are not suitable for q-LoRA, only the quantized version (Int4, Int8) is suitable. Another problem is that some of the opensoure LLMs do not provide quantized version.\nWith Auto-GPTQ we can quantize the LLMs with less resource, since it uses both GPU VRAM, and CPU RAM. This is archievable with consumer devices.\nIn this post, we will show how to use Auto-GPTQ to quantize an LVLM (Qwen-VL-Guidance).\nFirst, we need to import all below libraries.\nimport argparse\nimport json\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport logging\n\nimport torch\nimport os \nimport transformers\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\nfrom transformers.trainer_pt_utils import LabelSmoother\nfrom auto_gptq import AutoGPTQForCausalLM, BaseQuantizeConfig\nargs = {\n    'model_path': 'models/qwen_vl_guidance', # Qwen-VL-Guidance Path \n    'data_path': 'SeeClick/data/mind2web_train_sft.json', # Calibration data path\n    'max_len': 2048, # Max sequence length of the model\n    'bits': 4, # 4 or 8 for Int4 or Int8\n    'group_size': 128, \n    'out_path': '/quantization/qwen-gui-int4' # Output path for quantized model\n}\ngroup_size is the size in layers in a group being quantized, if group_size is too large, it will cause large quantization error.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\ndata_path is used for calibration process. It should be large enough, otherwise it will worsen the performance of quantized version model.\n\n\nquantize_config = BaseQuantizeConfig(\n        bits=args.bits,\n        group_size=args.group_size,\n        damp_percent=0.01,\n        desc_act=False,  # set to False can significantly speed up inference but the perplexity may slightly bad\n        static_groups=False,\n        sym=True,\n        true_sequential=True, \n        model_name_or_path=None,\n        model_file_base_name=\"model\"\n    )\ndamp_percent is set to 1% to avoid quantization error. It is usually set from 1% to 10%. Higher damp percent will increase the smoothing quantization, and lead to more quantization error.\n# set up logger\nlogging.basicConfig(\n        format=\"%(asctime)s %(levelname)s [%(name)s] %(message)s\", level=logging.INFO, datefmt=\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"\n    )\n\nlogging.info(\"loading tokenizer\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(args.model_path, trust_remote_code=True) # load the tokenizer\ntokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eod_id # set pad_token_id to eod \nlogging.info(\"loading data\")\ndata = preprocess(json.load(open(args.data_path)), tokenizer, args.max_len)\n\nlogging.info(\"loading model\")\nWhy do we need to set padding token tokenizer.pad_token_id to end of document (EOD) token tokenizer.eod_id?\nmodel = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_pretrained(args.model_path, \n                                            quantize_config,\n                                            low_cpu_mem_usage=True, \n                                            trust_remote_code=True,\n                                            torch_dtype=torch.float32 \n                                            )\nlogging.info(\"model loaded successfully\")\n\nmodel.quantize(data, cache_examples_on_gpu=False) # set cache_examples_on_gpu to False to avoid OOM error\n\n\nmodel.save_quantized(args.output_path, use_safetensors=True) # save quantized model\ntokenizer.save_pretrained(args.output_path) # save tokenizer for quantized\ntorch_dtype should be set to torch.float32 for CPU running, since torch.float16 is not supported in CPU.\nIn summary above, with limited resource we can quantize LLMs into quantized version, and then use q-LoRA to fine tune the model. This quantized model is comparable with the original model, but only required a lot less VRAM on GPUs."

Resizing and Cropping Images\nResize images to a specific width and height or by a scaling factor. Cropping involves selecting a region of interest (ROI) from the image.\nimport cv2\n# Read an image\nimage = cv2.imread('image.jpg')\n\n# Resize the image to a specific width and height\nnew_width, new_height = 200, 200\nresized_image = cv2.resize(image, (new_width, new_height))\n\n# Resize the image by a scaling factor\nscale_percent = 50  # percent of original size\nwidth = int(image.shape[1] * scale_percent / 100)\nheight = int(image.shape[0] * scale_percent / 100)\nresized_image = cv2.resize(image, (width, height))\ncv2.imwrite('resized.jpg', resized_image)\n\n# Crop a region of interest (ROI) from the image\nx, y, w, h = 100, 100, 200, 200  # Example coordinates and dimensions\ncropped_image = image[y:y+h, x:x+w]\ncv2.imwrite('cropped.jpg', cropped_image)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResized\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCropped\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Flipping Images\nThe function flip flips the array in one of three different ways (row and column indices are 0-based): dst = cv.flip( src, flipCode ) dst: output array of the same size and type as src.\nThe function has 2 required arguments:\n\nsrc: input image\nflipCode: a flag to specify how to flip the array; 0 means flipping around the x-axis and positive value (for example, 1) means flipping around y-axis. Negative value (for example, -1) means flipping around both axes.\n\n\nimport cv2\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimg_bgr = cv2.imread('image.jpg')\nimg_rgb = img_bgr[:, :, ::-1]\n\nimg_rgb_flipped_horz = cv2.flip(img_rgb, 1)\nimg_rgb_flipped_vert = cv2.flip(img_rgb, 0)\nimg_rgb_flipped_both = cv2.flip(img_rgb, -1)\n\n# Show the images\nplt.figure(figsize=(18, 5))\nplt.subplot(141) # 141 : 1 row, 4 columns, current index of subplot\nplt.imshow(img_rgb)\nplt.title(\"Original\")\nplt.subplot(142) \nplt.imshow(img_rgb_flipped_horz)\nplt.title(\"Horizontal Flip\")\nplt.subplot(143)\nplt.imshow(img_rgb_flipped_vert)\nplt.title(\"Vertical Flip\")\nplt.subplot(144)\nplt.imshow(img_rgb_flipped_both)\nplt.title(\"Both Flipped\")\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Reading and Displaying Videos\nimport cv2\n\n# Open a video file\ncap = cv2.VideoCapture('video.mp4')\n\nwhile cap.isOpened():\n    ret, frame = cap.read()\n    if not ret:\n        break\n    cv2.imshow('Video', frame)\n    if cv2.waitKey(25) & 0xFF == ord('q'):\n        break\n\ncap.release()\ncv2.destroyAllWindows()\nFore more reference, visit OpenCV Documentation"

With this access, the malicious page can redirect the original page (the one that opened the link) to a phishing site, alter its content, or perform other malicious actions.\n\nReverse tabnabbing can be exploited by attackers to deceive users into thinking they are interacting with a legitimate website while actually being redirected to a malicious one.\nTo mitigate this security risk, web developers can use the following methods:\n\nRel=“noopener noreferrer”: Adding rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" to anchor (&lt;a&gt;) elements that open links in a new tab or window prevents the newly opened page from accessing window.opener and ensures that the HTTP referer header is not sent, enhancing both security and privacy.\nExplicit Rel=“noopener”: Alternatively, if noreferrer is not desired, using rel=\"noopener\" alone can prevent access to window.opener.

    "text": "Activation functions\nThe activation fuction is a transformation function in NN that transform the weight and bias into a nonlinear format. With Activation function, model can learn and represent more complex patterns in data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes activation function must be a nonlinear function ? Why ?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn neural networks, activation functions are typically designed to be nonlinear. This is because if all activation functions were linear, the entire neural network would effectively become a linear model, incapable of capturing complex nonlinear relationships.\nIf all activation functions were set to linear functions, even a very deep neural network would behave like a single-layer linear model. Such a model would fail to handle many real-world nonlinear relationships, limiting the expressiveness and applicability of neural networks.\n\n\n\n\nReLU\nThe Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function is one of the most widely used activation functions in deep learning. It’s defined as:\n\\[f(x) = \\max(0, x)\\]\nIn simple terms, ReLU returns if x is positive, and 0 otherwise. This makes it a piecewise linear function.\nReLU has several advantages:\n\nSimplicity: ReLU is computationally efficient and easy to implement. It only involves a simple thresholding operation, making it faster to compute compared to more complex activation functions like sigmoid or tanh.\nSparsity: ReLU introduces sparsity in the network because it turns off neurons that have negative inputs (setting their output to zero). This sparsity can help reduce overfitting by encouraging the network to focus on important features and ignore noise.\nAddressing vanishing gradient problem: ReLU helps mitigate the vanishing gradient problem by providing a constant gradient (1) for positive inputs during backpropagation. This helps prevent the gradients from becoming too small, enabling more stable and efficient training of deep neural networks.\n\nDespite its advantages, ReLU also has some drawbacks:\n\nDead neurons: Neurons with negative inputs always output zero, leading to the problem of “dying ReLU neurons.” If a neuron’s weights are such that it always receives negative inputs, it will never activate, and its weights will not be updated during training.\nUnbounded output: ReLU does not have an upper bound, which means neurons can potentially produce very large outputs. This can lead to issues like exploding gradients, especially during training.\n\n\n\nLeaky ReLU\nLeaky ReLU is a variant of the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, designed to address the “dying ReLU” problem. In standard ReLU, neurons with negative inputs always output zero, which can cause them to become “dead” and stop learning. Leaky ReLU introduces a small slope (or “leak”) for negative inputs, allowing some information to flow through the neuron even when its input is negative. Mathematically, Leaky ReLU is defined as:\n\\[\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\nx & \\text{if } x &gt; 0 \\\\\n\\alpha x & \\text{if } x \\leq 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is a small constant (typically a small positive value: 0.01 or 0.001) that determines the slope of the function for negative inputs."

    "text": "Why can’t we reach our goal?\nIt is because people don’t like to invest in means. People often resist investing time, effort, or resources into the processes or tools necessary to achieve a goal. Instead, they prefer to focus on the outcomes or ends themselves. This can reflect a tendency to undervalue the importance of preparation, tools, or steps required to reach a desired result, possibly because the means are seen as tedious, time-consuming, or not immediately rewarding. In other words, people may be more motivated by the final goal (the end) rather than the steps needed to achieve it (the means).\nThe motivation level is at its peak in the beginning of the project, and at the end (deadline), but not the middle.
