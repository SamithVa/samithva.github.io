## What is Pig Game ? 

"Pig" is a simple and fun dice game that involves a bit of strategy and luck, and it's great for two players. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points or other value set by the player.

## Rules of Pig Game

Turns: Players take turns to roll the die as many times as they choose on each turn.

Scoring: Each roll is added to a turn total, but if the player rolls a 1, their turn ends and their turn total is lost.

Holding: At any point during their turn, a player may choose to "hold". When a player holds, the turn total (the sum of the dice rolls during that turn) is added to their overall score.

Winning: The game continues until one of the players reaches or exceeds 100 points.

## Building Processes

### 1. Select DOM Elements 

- Using `strict` at the beginning, so that JS stopped running when there is an error.
- We select button elements using `querySelector`. 
- Scores store both player score, which score[0] stores Player 1's score and score[1] stores Player 2's score.
- Initialize all the variables

```javascript
"use strict";

const player0 = document.querySelector(".player--0");
const player1 = document.querySelector(".player--1");

const scoreEl0 = document.getElementById("score--0");
const scoreEl1 = document.getElementById("score--1");
const currentScoreEl0 = document.getElementById("current--0");
const currentScoreEl1 = document.getElementById("current--1");

const btnNew = document.querySelector(".btn--new");
const btnRoll = document.querySelector(".btn--roll");
const btnHold = document.querySelector(".btn--hold");

let winScore = Number(document.getElementById("win-score").value);
let currentScore = 0;
let currentPlayer = 0;
let Gameover = false;

const diceEl = document.querySelector(".dice");

let scores = [0, 0];
```


### 2. New Game

When 'NEW GAME' button is clicked, we trigger the `newGame()` function.

```javascript
btnNew.addEventListener("click", () => {
  Gameover = false;
  newGame();
});
```

In `newGame()` function, We check if the currentPlayer contain `player--winner` class, if it does class we then remove the class to begin the game.

```javascript
// newGame
const newGame = function () {
  currentScore = 0;
  scores = [0, 0];
  const currentPlayerEle = document.querySelector(`.player--${currentPlayer}`);
  if (currentPlayerEle.classList.contains("player--winner")) {
    currentPlayerEle.classList.remove("player--winner");
  }
  removeAllActive();
  currentPlayer = Math.floor(Math.random() + 0.5);
  document
    .querySelector(`.player--${currentPlayer}`)
    .classList.add("player--active");
  // hide dice
  diceEl.classList.add("hidden");
  // reset scores to 0
  scoreEl0.textContent = 0;
  scoreEl1.textContent = 0;
  currentScoreEl0.textContent = 0;
  currentScoreEl1.textContent = 0;
};
```

To start the game equally, we random a number 0-1, if it is 0, start with Player 1, otherwise Player 2 start the game. 

```javascript
currentPlayer = Math.floor(Math.random() + 0.5);
```

But we first call function `removeAllActive` to remove active player class from all both players.

```javascript
const removeAllActive = function () {
  if (player0.classList.contains("player--active")) {
    player0.classList.remove("player--active");
  }
  if (player1.classList.contains("player--active")) {
    player1.classList.remove("player--active");
  }
};
```




### 3. Rolling Button

We then an eventListener to the Rolling button. When the rolling button is clicked :

- Dice is unhidden
- Random number between 1 to 6
- If random number is 1, switch the player by trigger `switchPlayer()` function.

```javascript
const switchPlayer = function () {
  currentScore = 0;
  document.getElementById(`current--${currentPlayer}`).textContent =
    currentScore;
  currentPlayer = currentPlayer === 1 ? 0 : 1;
  player0.classList.toggle("player--active");
  player1.classList.toggle("player--active");
};
```

- If random number is not 1, add the score to current score.

```js
// rolling button
btnRoll.addEventListener("click", () => {
  // show dice
  if (!Gameover) {
    diceEl.classList.remove("hidden");

    const randDice = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
    diceEl.src = `dice-${randDice}.png`;
    // Add score to current score
    if (randDice !== 1) {
      currentScore += randDice;
      document.getElementById(`current--${currentPlayer}`).textContent =
        currentScore;
    }
    // Switch the player
    else {
      switchPlayer();
    }
  }
});
```

### 4. Hold Button 

When hold button is click, it will :

- If the game has not ended add the current score to player overall score.
- Switch to other player
- If one of the player win the game, add a `player--winner` class to that player.

```javascript
// hold button
btnHold.addEventListener("click", () => {
  winScore = Number(document.getElementById("win-score").value);
  if (!Gameover) {
    scores[currentPlayer] += currentScore;
    document.getElementById(`score--${currentPlayer}`).textContent =
      scores[currentPlayer];
    if (scores[currentPlayer] >= winScore) {
      document
        .querySelector(`.player--${currentPlayer}`)
        .classList.add("player--winner");
      document
        .querySelector(`.player--${currentPlayer}`)
        .classList.remove("player--active");
      diceEl.classList.add("hidden");
      Gameover = true;
    } else {
      switchPlayer();
    }
  }
});
```
