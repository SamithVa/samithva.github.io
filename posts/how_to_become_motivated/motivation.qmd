I recently watched a compelling TED talk by [Ayelet Fishbach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3CvsPAF3_0&pp=ygUtaG93IHRvIHNldCB0aGUgcmlnaHQgZ29hbHMgYW5kIHN0YXkgbW90aXZhdGVk) on the subject of motivation *How to Set Right Goal and Stay Motivated*. Here are some key takeaways and reflections from the talk that I found particularly enlightening:

## What is Motivation? 

Motivation is not an inherent trait or an innate quality that some people are born with. Rather, it is a skill or mindset that can be developed and nurtured over time. The essence of motivation lies not just in sheer willpower but in understanding and applying strategic wisdom.

## Why Do We Struggle to Reach Our Goals?

One common reason people fail to achieve their goals is their reluctance to invest in the necessary processes and tools. Instead of focusing on the means—the time, effort, and resources required to reach a goal—people often fixate on the outcomes themselves. This tendency can lead to undervaluing the importance of preparation and the steps needed for success. Consequently, motivation tends to peak at the beginning of a project and again as a deadline approaches, but may wane in the middle, leading to procrastination.

The motivation level is at its peak in the beginning of the project, and at the end (deadline), but not the middle. Hence many people tend to put off or procrastinate their works near to deadline.

To address this issue, it helps to shorten the perceived length of the journey. For instance, if your goal is to build muscle, setting short-term objectives (like weekly or daily goals) can make the process feel more manageable and less overwhelming. 

## How to encounter setbacks in achieving goal?

Encountering setbacks is a natural part of pursuing any goal. To effectively handle these obstacles, it’s important to set aside your ego and approach failures as learning opportunities. Remind yourself that setbacks are temporary and part of the growth process. 

> Embrace the idea that “no pain, no gain” can be a motivational tool to push through challenges.

## Avoiding Temptation?

Rather than focusing solely on achieving the end goal, try to immerse yourself in the process of reaching it. Think of yourself as someone who is experimenting and discovering the right methods rather than just a person trying to achieve a specific result. Cultivate curiosity and enjoyment in the journey itself.

## How to avoid temptation?

Anticipating potential temptations can significantly aid in managing them. For example, if you often face stress-induced cravings late at night, prepare alternative strategies for handling these moments. Consider going for a walk, drinking a glass of water, or engaging in a relaxing activity instead of giving in to unhealthy snacks.
