## Thermal Noise in Resistor

For ideal inductor and capacitor, is there noise ?

Thermal noise the most significant noise encountered in electronic devices. We can model the thermal in two ways:

![Thermal Noise Equilvalent Circuit](thermal_noise.png)

1. Thevenin 
$$\bar{V}^2_n = 4kTR_1$$
2. Norton
$$\bar{I}^2_n = 4kT/R_1$$

Where 

- $k = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J/K$ is the Boltzmann constant.
- $T$ is the temperature kelvin $(K)$

## Thermal noise in MOSFET

![Thermal noise in MOSFET](mosfet_thermal_noise.png)
Thermal noise of MOS transistors which is operating in the **saturation region** is approximated by :

1. A **current source** tied between the source and drain terminals.
$$\bar{I_n}^2 = 4kT \gamma g_m$$

2. A **voltage source** in series with gate
$$\bar{V_n}^2 = 4kT \gamma / g_m$$ 

Where 

- $\gamma$ is the excess noise coefficient
- $g_m$ is the transconductance.

## Noise Figure

In circuit and system design, we interested in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To quantify how noisy the circuit is, we can define its noise factor as

$$\text{NF} = \frac{\text{SNR}_\text{in}}{\text{SNR}_\text{out}}$$

or Noise figure in dB as

$$\text{NF}|_\text{dB} = 10\log(\frac{\text{SNR}_\text{in}}{\text{SNR}_\text{out}})$$

What is the NF for noiseless stage ?

## Noise Figure in LNA

![LNA Noise Model (RF Microelectronics, Behzad Razavi, P49)](noise-model.png)

We can have 
$$\alpha = \frac{Z_\text{in}}{Z_\text{in} + R_S}$$
$$\text{SNR}_\text{in} = \frac{V^2_\text{in}\alpha^2}{\bar{V}^2_\text{n,RS}\alpha^2} = \frac{V^2_\text{in}}{\bar{V}^2_\text{n,RS}}$$

$$\text{SNR}_\text{out} = \frac{V^2_\text{in}\alpha^2 {A^2}_v}{\bar{V}^2_\text{n,RS}\alpha^2 {A^2}_v + \bar{V}^2_n}$$

$$ NF = \frac{\text{SNR}_\text{in}}{\text{SNR}_\text{out}} = 1 + \frac{\bar{V}_n ^ 2}{\bar{V}^2_\text{n,RS} \alpha^2 A_v ^2}$$

## Friis Equation for Cascaded Stages

To determine overall noise figure in a cascade of stages, we can use Friis's equation  :

$$NF_{\text{total}} = {NF}_1 + \frac{NF_2 - 1}{A^2_1} + ... + \frac{{NF}_n - 1}{A^2_1...A^2_n}$$

From above expression we can conclude that the first stage's NF is the most important. Why ?

Conceptually, because the noise from first stage will be amplified multiple times.
