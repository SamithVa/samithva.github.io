Two important specification of PA : 

1. Power efficiency
2. Linearity

# Efficiency

## Power Efficiency

$$\eta = \frac{P_L}{P_\text{supply}}$$

## Power-added Efficiency

$$\text{PAE} = \frac{P_L - P_\text{in}}{P_\text{supply}}$$

# LNA vs PA 

Can we just use LNA as PA ?

The answer is simply a no,

| LNA                                 | PA                                               |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| focus on the input                  | focus on the output                              |
| input impedance matching is crucial | exact output impedance matching is not necessary |
| Power efficiency is not relevant    | Power efficiency is not that crucial             |

Another important differences between LNA and PA is that MOSFET need to be in Saturation Region for PA (What's about LNA?).


# Conduction Angle

The percentage of the signal period during which the transistor(s) remain on multiplied by 360 degree. 

# Difference types of PAs
## Type A PA

![Type A PA](pa_type_a.png)

- Always on (conduction angle = 360)
- Low efficiency : 30 - 35% (maximum is 50%)

$$i_\text{RF} = \frac{V_\text{DD}}{R_L}$$

## Type B PA

![Type B PA](pa_type_b.png)

- Not always on (usually 50% on, maximum is 78.5%, conduction angle = 180)
- Efficiency is higher than type A PA
- Higher nonlinearity (tradeoff between efficiency and linearity)

$$i_\text{fund} = \frac{i_\text{RF}}{2}$$

## Type C PA

![Type C PA](pa_type_c.png)

$$\eta =\frac{1}{4}\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{\sin\frac{\theta}{2}-\frac{\theta}{2}\cos\frac{\theta}{2}}$$
