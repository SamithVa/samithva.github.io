## Resistance and Reactance

Resistance is a property of a material or component in a circuit that opposes the flow of electric current. It's essentially the friction or obstruction that electrons encounter as they move through a conductor. Resistance **does dissipate power** in the form of heat.

Reactance **does not dissipate power** in the form of heat. Instead, it represents the *energy storage* and release mechanism associated with capacitors and inductors in *AC circuits*. Reactance is also **frequency-dependent**, meaning it varies with the frequency of the AC signal.

## Resonant

At resonance, the circuit impedance is at its minimum impedance, leading to **Maximum Current Flow**: At resonance, the impedance of the circuit is at its minimum value. 

Since impedance is the combination of resistance, inductive reactance, and capacitive reactance, when $X_C$​ and $X_L​$ cancel each other out, the overall impedance decreases. According to Ohm's Law $I = \frac{V}{Z}$,  a decrease in impedance at resonance leads to an increase in current flow.

### Quality Factor

![Q Factor](q-factor.png){width=80%}

$$Q = \frac{1}{R}\sqrt{\frac{L}{{C}}}$$

What is the physical meaning of Q factor ? 
: It's the ratio of energy stored to energy dissipated per cycle.

$$Q = \omega_0 . \frac{\text{energy stored}}{\text{average power dissipated}}$$

### Bandwidth

Bandwidth is defined as then the current or voltage drop by 3 dB when it's get away from resonant frequency. 

$$\Delta\omega = \frac{\omega_0}{2Q}$$

## Series and Parallel RLC Transformation

## Impedance Matching 

1. Why don't we just use parallel resistor in impedance matching instead of using LC components?

## Loss of impedance matching circuit 

no source RLC circuit : noise figure = loss
