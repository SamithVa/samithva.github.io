Mixer is a very important component in modern RF, without it we may not be able to convert from low frequency (IF) into higher frequency (RF) or vice versa, and it will not be suitable for high data rate transmission. In this post, we will explore on different types of mixers as well as their basic design concepts. 

# Questions 

1. What is a mixer ? 
1. Mixer itself is a nonlinear device, why do we care about linearity?
2. What are two common types of mixers ? Can we use MOSFET in forming a mixer ? Which MOSFET working region should be if it is used in these two types of mixers ?
3. What is *spurs* ? How it differ from *IP3* ? 
4. What is *IP2* ? Is it significant in mixers ? 
5. What is *feedthrough* ? (Is it because of capacitors between gate-source and gate-drain, how do we call these capacitors?)
6. Is LO-RF feedthrough more crucial than LO-IF in DCR, Why ? 
7. What is the gain for single and double balanced mixers ? Is the gain higher for double balanced mixer ? 

# Performance Metrics

## Conversion Gain 

Knowing a mixer's conversion gain we can know how much signal is preserved/amplified after the mixing
$$\text{Conversion Gain} = \frac{V_\text{IF}}{V_\text{RF}}$$

## Feedthrough

In high frequency, MOSFET model contains parasitic capacitance between terminals, this eventually lead to feedthrough problem (leakage between terminals).

# Type of Mixers

There are two common types of mixers: switch mixer and analog multiplier mixer. These two have their own benefits and drawback. In most cases the tradeoff between gain and nonlinearity is inevitable. 

## Switch Mixer

![Switch Mixer](switch_mixer.png)

- Low efficiency (contains DC offset etc.)
- Perform well in linearity and feedthrough, Hence more commonly used in modern RF devices

### RZ and NRZ Mixers

RZ mixer and NRZ mixer (Sampling mixer)

Sampling mixer : $1.5 dB$

#### Single and Double Balanced Mixers

Single Balanced Mixer 


Double Balanced Mixer 

![Double Balanced Mixer](double_balanced.png)

:::{.callout-note}
Voltage conversion gain for single-balanced and double-balanced RZ mixer : $$\frac{2}{\pi} \approx -4 dB$$

#### Sampling Mixer or NRZ Mixer

NRZ : Non-Return-Zero 

#### Single Balance Sampling Mixer

### Double Balance Sampling Mixer



## Analog Multiplier Mixer

- High gain 
- High nonlinearity (Is this good or bad in RF? Remember IP3?)

## Passive and Active Mixers

Passive mixers gain is smaller than 1, but with active mixers, the conversion gain can be greater than 1. 

# Leakage Problem in Mixers

## Injection Pull (RF-LO)

This problem occurs in DCR, which high interference from RF enters into LO, and eventually degrades LO's performance (make LO to become unstable).
