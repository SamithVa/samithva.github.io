This post will include answers to these questions:

1. What is the problem of direct filtering? 
2. What is the premise of heterodyne design? What is the image problem in heterodyne architecture?  
3. What is the trade-off between image-rejection and channel-selection? Which one is more preferable high-IF or low-IF?
4. What is the *mixing spurs* problem?
5. What is the *self-image* or *self-corruption* problem?
6. What are “symmetrically-modulated” and “asymmetrically-modulated” signals?
7. Why do we need *quadrature down conversion*? 
8. What is sliding-IF receivers ? How many oscillators in the modern heterodyne? How to achieve frequency division, what electronic component we should use?(Hint : it starts with 'C')
9. Why direct conversion is superior to heterodyne? (Hint : 3 aspects, Image, LPF and  Spurs)
10. What is the problem of LO leakage in direct conversion? Does it happen in heterodyne as well? 

# Direct Filtering

![High Q-Factor Problem in Direct Filtering](high_q_factor.png)

Can we design a circuit directly filter out the noise in Receiver side ?
What is its limitation ? 

In short answer, we can't build such filter due to large value of Q (quality factor) which is impossible to make with conventional passive devices. 

# Superheterodyne

![Superheterodyne Basic Idea](superheterodyne.png)

How it work ? First shift the high frequency signal (RF frequency) into intermediate frequency (IF frequency) using a mixer. Then using LPF to filter out undesired interferences and keep only those within the band we want. 

Why does it have smaller Q ? 
$Q = \frac{\omega_0}{2\Delta \omega}$ , obviously $\omega_0$ is smaller after we shifted it from RF to IF. 

## Zero Second IF

A design that moves IF near to zero frequency.

## Image Rejecting

![Image Rejection](image_rejection.png)

After shifted into IF, **self-corruption** or **image problem** can be a problem as well. Image is the interference, whose its frequency is symmetric with desired signal respect to frequency of the local oscillator (LO). 
Hence in order to avoid signal corruption, we must eliminate the image by using Image Reject Filter (IRF).

IMRR : Image Rejection Ratio 

### High IF and Low IF

![High IF and Low IF Comparison](high_if_low_if.png)

Why high IF is more preferable ? Because the frequency of image is far from desired signal, hence we can easily filter out with lower Q factor. 

High $\omega_{IF}$  -> Easy to design IRF, but what is the trade-off of high-IF? 

### High Side Injection and Low Side Injection

High side injection : mixed with higher frequency ($\omega_{LO} > \omega_{in}$), this can also be called **superdyne**. 
Low side injection : mixed with lower frequency ($\omega_{LO} < \omega_{in}$), this can also be called **infradyne**.

### Quadrature Downconversion

![Self-corruption problem](self-corruption.png)

Why we need it ? Because in these days most modulation method is asymmetric, using quadrature  down conversion technique, we can then eliminate the self-corruption problem. 

# Direct Conversion Receiver

Direct Conversion Receiver(DCR) eliminates the image problem. But new problem comes thereafter, LO leakage. 

## LO leakage 

![LO Leakage](lo_leakage.png)

But with modern DSP, the LO leakage can be handled easily now, hence DCR is more commonly used in modern RF devices.

# Image-Reject Receiver

What are the differences between Harley and Weaver Architecture ?

## Harley Architecture

## Weaver Architecture

It is basically a type of injection (high or low injection), but there will be more problem in nonlinearity.
