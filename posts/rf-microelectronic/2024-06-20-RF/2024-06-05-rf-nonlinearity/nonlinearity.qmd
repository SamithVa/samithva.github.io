In analog circuits, nonlinearity can be characterized by **harmonic distortion**, but in RF circuits, the characterization of nonlinear behavior involves distinct measures that are tailored to the specific requirements and challenges of RF systems. The effects of nonlinearity on RF can be classified into 4 types : 

These measures often focus on parameters such as intermodulation distortion (IMD), third-order intercept point (IP3), and the dynamic range of the system.

### Gain
#### Power gain 
$$A_\text{P | dB} = 10\log(\frac{P_\text{out}}{P_\text{in}})$$

#### Voltage gain
$$A_\text{V | dB} = 20\log(\frac{V_\text{out}}{V_\text{in}})$$

:::{.callout-note}
$V_\text{out},V_\text{in}$ are measured in *rms*.
:::

Why does the coefficient change to 20 in voltage gain ? Are $A_P$ and $A_V$ equal?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
$P = \frac{V^2}{R}$
Obviously $A_P$ and $A_V$ are equivalent only when resistance $R$ remain the constant in input and output ports.
</details> 

#### Absolute Power Gain
In most cases, to simplify the expression of low power communication devices, power is usually expressed in dBm, a log unit of $\text{mW}$ (milliwatt).
$$P_\text{dBm} = 10\log(\frac{P}{1\text{ mW}})$$

### Voltage

$V_\text{rms}$ : root-mean square voltage

$V_P$ : peak voltage

$V_{PP}$ : peak-to-peak voltage
$$V_\text{rms} = \frac{1}{T}\sqrt{\int_0^T V^2(t) dt}$$
$$V_\text{P} = \sqrt2 V_\text{rms} = \frac{V_{PP}}{2}$$

What is $V_{PP}$ correspond to 0 dBm?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
$V_{PP} = 632$ mV

### Harmonic distortion

Harmonic distortion in RF (Radio Frequency) communication circuits refers to the presence of unwanted frequency components in the output signal that are integer multiples of the original frequency, known as **harmonics**. 

When a signal passes through an RF circuit, non-linearities in the components can cause the generation of harmonics. A memoryless systems whose input/output characteristic can be approximated by

$$y(t) = \alpha_1 x(t) + \alpha_2 x^2 (t)+ \alpha_3 x^3(t)$$

If input $x(t) = A\cos(\omega t)$, The fundamental term of this nonlinear system can be determined: 
$$y(t) \approx A\cos(\omega t) (\alpha_1 + \frac{3}{4}\alpha_3 A^2) = x(t)(\alpha_1 + \frac{3}{4}\alpha_3 A^2) $$
Where $A$ is the peak value amplitude

From above expression we can conclude that due to the linearity, the gain has changed from 
$\alpha_1$ to $\alpha_1 + \frac{3}{4}\alpha_3 A^2$

### Gain compression 
A small-signal gain of circuits is usually obtained when harmonic distortion is *negligible* (Why is it negligible?, e.g $0.01^4 < 0.01$). However, from above expression when harmonic distortion is considered, the gain might be actually become smaller (compressive).

What is Gain Compression?
: Gain compression occurs when the gain of an amplifier decreases as the input signal level increases (from above formula we can see that that's when $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_3$ have opposite sign). 

How can we measure this compression quantity?
: 1-dB compression point is the amount of voltage that can make the gain decrease by 1-dB 
$$
P_{\text{in},1\text{dB}} =A_{\text{in},1\text{dB}} = \sqrt{0.145\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_3}}
$$
$P_\text{1dB}$ is generally 220 to 225 dBm (63.2 to 35.6 m $V_{pp}$ in 50 $\Omega$ system). 

### Desensitization 

Desensitization in RF systems refers to a phenomenon where the sensitivity of a receiver decreases due to interference or strong nearby signals. If we consider the input signal $x(t) = A_1\cos(\omega_1 t) + A_2\cos(\omega_2 t)$, where $ A_2\cos(\omega_2 t)$ is the interference. Then the fundamental term of $y(t)$ can be expressed as 
$$y(t) = (\alpha_1 + \frac{3}{4}\alpha_3 A_1^2 +\frac{3}{2}\alpha_3 A_2^2)A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t)$$

When $A_2 >> A_1$, hence
$$y(t) = (\alpha_1 +\frac{3}{2}\alpha_3 A_2^2)A_1 \cos(\omega_1 t)$$


This will lead to **blocking signal** or **blocker** which refers to interferers that desensitize a circuit, even if they do not reduce the gain to zero (but as the amplitude increases, the gain might decrease to nearly zero). Some RF receivers must be able to withstand such interferences, those are **60 to 70 dB** greater than the desired signal.

### Cross Modulation 

Cross modulation become significant in **AM** (Amplitude modulation). When interference signal is amplitude modulated, it can lead the original signal to be amplitude modulated. 

### Intermodulation 

Imagine we have two signals, Signal A and Signal B, passing through a nonlinear component like an amplifier or mixer in an RF system. When these signals interact in the nonlinear component, they create new frequencies that weren't originally there. These new frequencies are called intermodulation products.

For instance, if Signal A is at 100 MHz and Signal B is at 150 MHz, the intermodulation products could appear at frequencies like 50 MHz (150 - 100) and 250 MHz (150 + 100). Hence if our information bearing signal is working at frequency near to 50 MHz or 250 MHz, it will of course be corrupted.

::: {.callout-important}
Intermodulation : The signal is **not** mixed with the interferer, but is mixed with a combination of two interferences' component.

Cross modulation : The signal is **mixed** with the interferer

### Third-Intercept Point

![Third-Intercept Point](third-intercept.png)

To measure the intermodulation we can use relative IM (intermodulation), IM and $A_\text{IP3}$
$$\text{IM} = \frac{3}{4}\alpha_3 A_1A_2^2$$

$$\text{Relative IM} = 20\log(\frac{3\alpha_3 }{4\alpha_1}A^2) \text{ dBc}$$

$$A_\text{IIP3} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{3}|\frac{\alpha_1}{\alpha_3}|}$$

::: {.callout-note}
$A_{IIP3}$, $P_{IIP3}$ , $P_{IP3}$ are commonly used interchangeably.  
:::

What is the relation between $P_{1dB}$ and $P_{IP3}$?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
$\frac{P_{IP3}}{P_{1dB}} = 9.6$ dB
</details> 

### Thid-Intercept Point in Cascaded Stages 

If the gain of each stage is larger than unity, the nonlinearity of the latter stages become more **significant/critical**. 

$$\frac{1}{A^2_{IP3}} \approx \frac{1}{A^2_{IP3, 1}} + \frac{\alpha_1^2}{A^2_{IP3, 2}} + \frac{\alpha_1^2 \beta_1^2}{A^2_{IP3,3}} + ...$$
